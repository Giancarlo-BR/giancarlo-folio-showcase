            Hi, I'm Giancarlo Brandalise, an Information Systems student from Porto Alegre with a real passion for using technology to solve meaningful problems. For me, the best work happens at the intersection of data analytics and software development—where we can uncover insights and build the tools to act on them.

            Currently, as a Data Analytics Intern at White Cube, I get to dive into this every day. I spend my time validating data, automating processes with Python and PySpark, and bringing information to life with interactive Power BI dashboards. It's rewarding to see my work help the team make smarter, data-driven decisions.
          </p>

            Before this, I was an R&D Consultant Intern at Martinelli Advogados. That role was a fascinating look behind the curtain of the tech industry, managing tax incentive projects and getting a deep understanding of how APIs, frameworks, and IT businesses operate.

            My technical toolkit is broad—I'm comfortable building with Java (Spring Boot), JavaScript (React, MERN stack), and of course, Python. Whether I'm designing a backend API, wrangling a complex dataset, or creating a user-friendly dashboard, I enjoy the entire process of building something valuable.
